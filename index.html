        <p>Exericse: Now take the same game and plot the gameplay against the dramatic arc.</p>
<p>What elements of gamepley, if any, support each of these points?<br>How is the exposition of gameplay handled? Are controls and mechanics clearly explained? Are they intergrated with the dramatc premise? Is the goal clearly stated and intergrated<br>with the main conflict of the story?<br>How does the gameplay cause the dramatic tension to rise?<br>What deciding factor in the gameplay brings the game to a climax?<br>What happend in the resolution? Do the dramatic elements and gamplay elements help or hinder each other?<br>How might they be better intergrated to make the game work from an emotional standpoint?</p>
<ol>
<li>the skill related checkpoint, the time, the equipment, the consuming item all support these points.</li>
<li>The skill(which can be enhanced by equipment and item) affect the failrate of the checkpoint&gt; the checkpoint goes to different talks &gt; might lead to different solutions.<br>The controls and mechanics are clearly explained, and they are integrated with the dramatic premise. The goal is clearly stated and integrated.</li>
<li>The gameplay always play an important role when you are on the way to the climax. By the way, the game is more like linear game, but different choices made by your strong or<br>weak skills will lead to some different results. The climax is always there when you are reaching some point, but the performance is a liitle bit different and you can experience different emotions.</li>
<li>The deciding factor … Mainly focus on how you know about the case- like how many talks have you unlocked, have you collect enough imformation? When you got enough imformation, you will reach to the next climax.</li>
<li>In the resolution, some part of importance truth is revealed and the protagonist always gain something(bullet, injuries… memories.. love…). The elements sometimes help, sometimes hinder the things you get in the resolution. All depends on your choice</li>
<li>The game is ferfect. The elements of those no-use items can be enhanced maybe</li>

        <p>Exercise: Write out the premise for five games that you’ve played and describe how this premise enhances the game.</p>
<ol>
<li>Disco</li>
</ol>
<p>The game is set on a A rundown, working-class Island town. You play a drunk, losing memory police who need to enclose an murder in the town. The story begins when you wake up in your bed in a hotel of the town, after Hangover. You have an assistant police who help you to visit and investigate all the suspicious people and things.</p>
<p>The losing memory premise enhance the immersion of the player. You’re able to shape the police like yourself and do things like yourself.</p>
<p>The background setting is Elevated and mixed with reality, which allows you to do things forbidden in reality but you can still feel the real feeling.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Dark souls 3</li>
</ol>
<p>The game is set on a Broken and dead world eagers to fire. You play an undead, chosen one to pass the fire with limited power to fight against the enemies who prevent you from passing fire on the way. The story begins when you are called to pass the fire to the destination. You will meet limited people who is not your enemy, but some might want to help you some might not.</p>
<p>The undead characteristic makes the game challenging while the dead punishment is huge in the game, which balanced the difficulty I think.</p>
<p>And the helplessness is along all the way as limited friends here and even limited words, which is enhance the Enhance the rendering ability of lonely background. That makes you immersed as you don’t know what you will face in the silent environment.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>BABA IS YOU</li>
</ol>
<p>The game is set on some places with water, fire, rocks and so on. You play a creature called BABA at the beginning and story begins when you enter the first stage and the game asked you to win. During the game, you is always you, but not always BABA.</p>
<p>The game doesn’t have much premises, which makes the rule changeable and surprising.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Original Sins 3</li>
</ol>
<p>The game is set on a kind of old world, which has a kind of people with strong but dangerous secret power. You are one with the secret power but another kind of people called Warlock arrested you on a boat to prevent the danger of your power by a necklet. The story begins when you woke up on the Warlock’s boat and you’re heading to an island. You will be forced to be against the warlocks and find out the truth of the secret power along with your friends, who are also the same kind of people as you.</p>
<p>You’re supposed to be under the pressure of the Warlock, which makes you always want to beat them no matter they are right or not. &gt; immersion</p>
<p>The secret power allows different types of magic in the world, which can make all the unreasonable things reasonable.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Arcade D&amp;D</li>
</ol>
<p>The game is set on a magic world with dragon. You are one of the warrior who will always fight for normal people. The story begins at a small villiage defeat by monsters and you’re asked to beat them. You will grow stronger along the way which makes it possible for you to fight the final enemies, who want to rule the world.</p>
<p>That’s traditional adventure. Some basic elements are here to make up a adventurous journey, magic sword, dragon, potion… That’s always interesting because they will not exist in real world.</p>
