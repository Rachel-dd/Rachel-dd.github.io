        <p>Exercise: Compare and contrast the conflict in football to the conflict in poker. Describe how each game creates conflict for the players.</p>
<p>Football: You are in the team, and you are forced to compete with another team. You can have the ball or you can just stand by, but you should obey the rules or you will be Red card punished.<br>Body conflict is neccessary if you hold the ball, but the conflict can’t be too rude.<br>Your goal is to get more goals into the opponent’s net, so that your team can win the game. If you goal in your own net, the score will be your opppnents’.<br>Teamwork is also needed here.</p>
<p>Poker: Always you are alone, and compete with 3 or 2 other players. You hold the some cards in your hand, so do other players.<br>Mostly, no body conflict in poker, unless somebody is cheating and you’re angry. But the conflict is between the compare of the cards.<br>Your goal is to pass the cards faster that others, so you have to manage the cards in your hand and conflict with the others’ cards.<br>Sometimes you can enter into alliance with other player so that some enemy can be defeated quickly.</p>

        <p>Exercise: Can you think of a game that has no rules? If so, describe it. How about one rules? Why is this exercise difficult?</p>
<p>No rules: You’re nobody, no goal… Well that’s really hard to describe. I wanted to say human life has no rule, but actually we are ruled that we’re a human. We can only see things like a human and our All cognition are ruled in Human frame.</p>
<p>one rule: You’re a human in a world, do what ever you like.</p>
<p>Why difficult: If no rules, you can’t set goals. If no rules, your action will be meaningless.</p>

What steps do they need to take in each case-social, procedural, or technical?<br>There will clearly be differences in the beginning of a multiplayer card game versus a single-player digital game, but are there also similarities? If so, describe them.</p>
<p>Go Fish:<br>Start with friend’s invitation or you want to share a moment with friends, or you are bored at some party and just want to play a game with strangers. All seems social need at the beginning.<br>If you are new to the game, you should learn the rules from your friend first. Then when you know how to win, you will try to win in games at most of the time. You need to analyse the cards in table and learn your fellows’ bodylaguage.<br>You will grow stronger when you know the rules well and your firends’ game habits and so on.<br>You will gain A sense of achievement once you defeat a strong enemy(firend).<br>You can’t obey the rules, or your friend will not play with you.<br>You can cheat in game only if you can successfully cheat anybody around you. If you’re exposed, nobody likes to play with you.</p>
<p>Quake:<br>You might search for a RPG game that attracts you and you find Quake, or your friend knows that you might like this game so Quake is introduced to you.<br>When you start the game, you quickly learn that you have limite resources and you must stay alive to win the enemies(or the game).<br>You will grow stronger when you know more about the game, enemy, weapon and so on.<br>And you will gain A sense of achievement once you jump to the next level or defeat a strong enemy.<br>You can’t meet the enemy that don’t exits in the game. On the other hand, you are in a restricted world.<br>Sometimes you can cheat in game and nobody will be hurt. But maybe you will be hurt because this might reduce game fun.</p>

<p>The Game: Kenshi</p>
<p>Why i buy it? The game is high rated and it’s Wasteland style. I like Fallout so i buy it.</p>
<p>Actual feeling in game: I can’t stand the control of this game. The way it rotates and moves makes me feel not good.<br>Another thing is that the Wasteland style is not what i expected like Fallout–<br>The beginning town only have few people to interact and only few options and dialogues. I like talking with NPCs but this game didn’t satisfy me in the beginning.</p>
<p>What did it miss:<br>The changable control settings. —I suggest it at least to allow us to change settings.<br>Dialogue: That is what i expected. But i think this game style have its own audience. I’m just not in them now. — Add storytelling NPC<br>Rough picture: I don’t usually care about that. But combining with the Poor handling, this shortcoming has been magnified. – need money to improve<br>TOO free to play: Lack of novice guidance. There’s no goal at the beginning. — Set up a usefull mission at the beginning.</p>
<p>Actually i think i will try the game again in the future. The developer is updating the game all the time and i’d be happy to see it satisfy me some time in the future.</p>

<p>My detailed feelings when doing different actions:</p>
<p>When prepare to play: I feel relaxed. The preparation is a little bit time-consuming but I think it worth.<br>Stretching: a little bit tired today because my body is not so well. But i think Stretching is neccessary for doing sports. Especially the Dynamic stretching before sports and static stretching after sports.<br>Start to play: equiped with easier actions so that it will cost less energy. And made some juice to make sure i wont die in game(to gain life) Although today my body is not in a good mode,  i can still enjoy this game in a lighter way.<br>Find a secret treasure place: a little happy. I havn’t expected something like that.<br>Gain a B rank in small game: Not very happy. I though i could win S rank. But actully i will chalenge it again to gain a higher rank. Can’t wait to see how my friend practise in this game.<br>Get a new action: can’t wait to equip it !! High ACT and can practice the Abdominal muscles<br>During the game: I can gain all the objects along the way, which gives me A sense of achievement<br>Last Strech: feels good! Healthy!</p>
<p>My friend’s feelings when doing different actions:</p>
<p>Preparation: well equiped and with high tension. And start the time calculator which will start the time race with me.<br>Stretching: feel hot<br>Start to play: said “i try not to sweat”<br>During the game: “Oh i jump too high!” “Beat you!” “It’s a little bit tired for the Hero 1 action” “Cao!(when the rate is not Great but only Good)”<br>Really serious about her actions(sometimes with Ferocious expression) “She jumps, i want to jump too(means the game characters)”<br>-“are you tired?”(from the game aside)<br>-“Of course not! Pa!” — all seems she is very immersed in the game<br>Said yes when she complete a hard action. Said “cao” when take huge damage<br>“I will be a ass bumper!!”<br>After game: feel Happy to acquire new abilities, can’t wait to try. (Juice squeezing)<br>oh sorry i though she will stop but she continues to chanlenge the BOSS! Laughed when she is tired.<br>Tried hard not to die when fighting with boss, drinking lots of juice. Looks she likes Squat very much.<br>Feel regret to waste one juice.<br>The end: “I’m so tired…””Oh!(when see the reward) Good!”</p>
<p>Compare：</p>
<p>Preparation: I treat this game as a sports so i want to enjoy this game with my body. My friend is also dedicated to the sports but she seems cares about competition in game too.<br>Streching: I feel OK and she begins to feel hot. Seems my body is stronger than her.<br>Reaction to game narrations: Seems she is more immered in the game environment. She reacts to almost every sentence speaks to her. I’m not that immersed, i care more about the sports action and my body condition.<br>Reaction to the rate in games: I feel OK to get a lower rate and i tried to get better next time. She sometimes will be unhappy when get lower rate.<br>Reaction to the missing object: I will try another round to get that. She sometimes feel angry and stop playing(This hit her motivation).<br>After game: we all feel good because we feel that our body is better after that game.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The game: This game contains professional Sports training, fun and reasonable competitiveness between players.<br>This can make person who is not very deditated to sports in daily life to do more sports(My friend). </p>
<p>The player: Some player cares more about the feelings and experiences(me). I cares my body build after this game and this game make me do more sports.<br>Some player cares more about Fulfillment in game, like win the competition, gain more scores. They can be more immersed in games but also be easier to get frustrated.</p>
